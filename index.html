multi - line comments
if you find that useful -->

<!-- HTML files have two fundamental parts. (1) The head, (2) The body -->

<!-- The head contains things that you do not see on the page -->

<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>

<!-- The body contains thigs you see -->
<!-- Most elements both open and close, with the content in the middle -->
<!-- Indenting is optional, but helps with readability -->
<body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    <h2>My Second Heading</h2>
    <p>My Second paragraph.</p>
